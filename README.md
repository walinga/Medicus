Slack for medical professionals! 
Allows professionals to communicate within groups and discuss best course of action for patients.

How this idea works? 
The patient walks into the hospital and checks in with the receptionist. 
The receptionist adds the patient to the messaging platform / allows access for the patient to join the messaging platform. 
The patient is now able to describe his/her problems on the messaging platform and fills out necessary forms. 
This accelerates the process as he/she would not need to wait and meet with a nurse or other assistant before talking to the doctor. The nurse/doctors can directly reply with room number/wait time and other info the patient may need to know. 

Features:
* Encrypted Chat
* Doctors able to have different channels for each patient
* Required forms are easily shared, doctors can send the proper required forms to each of the patients. 
* Patients get matched with the best doctors based on success rate and availability for optimal efficiency.
